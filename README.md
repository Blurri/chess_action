# ♟️ Chess Roguelike

A terminal-based prototype of a roguelike tactics game inspired by chess.

## ✨ Concept

> “What if chess pieces could evolve, learn skills, and fight in dungeons?”

You control a small squad of chess-like units in a turn-based, grid-based battle system. Movement is based on classic chess rules, but with roguelike progression elements planned.

This is an early **Proof of Concept** focused on core gameplay mechanics.

## ✅ Current Features

- Terminal-based 8x8 grid
- Turn-based movement system
- Chess-style movement (Pawn, Knight)
- Simple combat: capture on move
- Basic enemy AI (move & attack)
- One battle per run (more coming)
- Clean code structure for expandability

## 🔧 Running the Prototype

Requires Python 3.10+  
Clone the repo and run:
